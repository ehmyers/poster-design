poster design
==============

This shows the progression of the creaton of a poster for my type class.  The focus of the poster is BATCAT, a cat with a Batman mask on.  This cat has special significance in my personal life, so I decided to feature it in my poster design.  Vectors were created in Illustrator CS5.5, and InDesign CS5.5 was used for the type.  This is a work still in progress, check back later for a more complete version.
